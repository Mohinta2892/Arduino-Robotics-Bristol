/*Here, the definition of the PID class begins. This is indicated by the keyword: "class"
  This is a general description of the data and functions that the class contains.
  To use a class, we must make a specific instance of the class by declaring it into the same way we declare a variable.
  For example, to create a version of the PID class, in our main file we might write:

  PID LeftWheelPID;
  PID RightWheelPID;

  This will create two instances of the PID class; one for the left wheel and one for the right wheel.
  Each class will have a full copy of all the variables and functions defined for that particular class.

       the class.
       For example, once we have made an instance of the PID class, we can call the update function by writing:

       LeftWheelPID.update();

       Note that this will only update the LeftWheelPID - RightWheelPID will not be updated unless we also call
